## Week 1: Danny's Diner
### Introduction
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 5 favourite foods: sushi, curry, ramen, okononiyaki and yakiniku.

Dannyâ€™s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.
### Dataset

Use SQL Server to create the dataset using the CREATE TABLE and INSERT INTO statements.
``` SQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sales;
CREATE TABLE sales (
	customer_id VARCHAR(1),
	order_date DATE,
	product_id INT
);
INSERT INTO sales
VALUES
	('A', '2024-01-03', '2'),
	('A', '2024-01-03', '3'),
	('A', '2024-01-07', '2'),
	('A', '2024-01-07', '5'),
	('A', '2024-01-08', '1'),
	('A', '2024-01-11', '1'),
  ...
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS menu;
CREATE TABLE menu (
	product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	product_name VARCHAR(11),
	price INT
);
INSERT INTO menu
VALUES
	('1', 'sushi', '10'),
	('2', 'curry', '15'),
	('3', 'ramen', '12'),
	('4', 'okononiyaki', '15'),
	('5', 'yakiniku', '20');
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS members;
CREATE TABLE members (
	customer_id VARCHAR(1) PRIMARY KEY,
	join_date DATE
);
INSERT INTO members
VALUES
	('A', '2024-08-31'),
	('B', '2024-08-02'),
	('C', '2024-08-26'),
	('D', '2024-07-23'),
	('E', '2024-07-26'),
	('F', '2024-08-27'),
  ...
ALTER TABLE sales
ADD CONSTRAINT cusomter_id FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES members(customer_id);
ALTER TABLE sales
ADD CONSTRAINT product_id FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES menu(product_id);
