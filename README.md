### Introduction
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 5 favourite foods: sushi, curry, ramen, okononiyaki and yakiniku.

Dannyâ€™s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.
### Business Goals

- *Support loyalty strategy*: These insights will help him decide whether to expand the loyalty program and personalize the experience for loyal customers.
